# Seal server overview

Seal supports two fundamentally different server types for key management: **Committee** (requires an aggregator server) and **Independent**.

## Committee server type

**Summary**: A committee server appears to clients as a single key server, but is operated by multiple independent key servers with distributed key shares. The committee's internal threshold provides built-in distributed trust, and committee members can rotate without changing the public key or requiring data re-encryption.

**Architecture and how it works:**

From the **client perspective**:
- Appears as one key server (configured with one object ID and one aggregator URL)
- Can be used in threshold configurations alongside independent servers
- No knowledge of or interaction with individual committee members
- The committee's internal threshold (e.g., 3-of-5 members) is completely transparent

From the **operator perspective**:
- Multiple operators participate in a DKG ceremony to generate individual master shares without any single party ever holding the complete master key
- Each committee member runs their own key server using their master share
- **An aggregator server is required** to coordinate with individual committee member key servers using API keys
- Clients send decryption requests to the aggregator server
- The aggregator collects partial keys from the committee key servers and combines them to serve the client
- Supports all packages without requiring allowlist or per-client approval

**Key feature - Committee rotation:**
Committee members can be added, removed, or replaced through a key rotation ceremony while:
- The key server's public key remains constant throughout its lifetime
- Existing encrypted data remains accessible without re-encryption
- Clients continue using the same key server object without any changes

**Use cases:**
- High-security deployments requiring distributed trust and avoiding single points of failure
- Multi-party governance scenarios with changing membership
- Long-term deployments needing operator flexibility without re-encryption

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced security through distributed key management - no single entity holds the complete master key
- Resilient to individual member compromise
- Committee member rotation while maintaining the same public key - members can be added, removed, or replaced without affecting clients or requiring data re-encryption
- Flexible governance allowing committee membership changes over time
- Simplified client configuration - clients only need to communicate with the aggregator, not individual committee members

**Considerations:**
- Key share setup and rotation requiring coordination among parties
- Requires an additional aggregator server component for client communication

## Independent server type

**Summary**: Independent servers are operated by a single entity. They offer two modes - **Open** (anyone can use for any package) and **Permissioned** (per-client access control with approved package IDs).

**Architecture and how it works:**

From the **client perspective**:
- Appears as one key server (configured with one object ID and one server URL)
- Can be used in threshold configurations alongside other independent servers or committee servers
- Direct client-to-key-server communication

From the **operator perspective**:
- Single entity operates the key server
- Two operating modes available:
  - **Open mode**: Uses a single master key to serve all access policies across all packages; accepts decryption requests for any on-chain package without restrictions; no client management or API keys required
  - **Permissioned mode**: Restricts access to a manually approved list of packages; each client is associated with specific package IDs; each client is served using a dedicated master key derived from a master seed; clients must obtain API keys for access; supports key import and export for disaster recovery or key server rotation

**Use cases:**

*Open mode*:
- Development and testing environments
- Public or general-purpose deployments

*Permissioned mode*:
- B2B deployments with multiple clients
- Multi-tenant scenarios requiring client isolation
- Production environments with access control requirements

**Benefits:**
- Open mode: Simple setup and configuration, no client management required
- Permissioned mode: Client-level isolation with dedicated keys, fine-grained access control per package, supports key export/import for flexibility

**Considerations:**
- Single point of operation (single entity operates the server)
- No rotation support: Changing selection of key servers requires data re-encryption since public keys change
- Open mode: No package-level access control, single master key serves all packages, not suitable for B2B or multi-tenant scenarios requiring isolation
- Permissioned mode: Requires client registration and management, manual approval process for new packages, higher operational overhead

## Common considerations

**For all key servers** (committee members and independent):
- **Sui full node access**: Trusted full node connection required for policy validation
- **HTTPS/TLS**: Recommended to place behind API gateway or reverse proxy
- **Rate limiting**: Protect against abuse through API gateway
- **Authentication**: Optional API keys or access tokens
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics on port 9184, health check on port 2024
- **Key storage**: Secure storage via KMS or hardware/software vault

**For aggregator servers** (committee server type only):
- Trustless component - anyone can run an aggregator
- No key storage required
- Coordinates with committee member key servers to collect and combine partial keys

**For client usage:** See [Using Seal](/UsingSeal) to learn how to integrate Seal into your application.

**For server operators:**

- **Independent key server**: See [Key Server Operations for Independent Server Type](/KeyServerOps) for detailed instructions on Open and Permissioned mode setup.
- **Committee key server**: See [Key Server Operations for Committee Server Type](/KeyServerCommitteeOps) for detailed setup instructions including DKG ceremonies, key rotation, and key server setup.
- **Aggregator server** (Committee server type only): See [Aggregator Server](/Aggregator) for aggregator configuration and setup.
