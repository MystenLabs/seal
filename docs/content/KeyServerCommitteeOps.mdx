# Key server operations for committee server type

This guide explains how to set up and operate a key server as a committee server type. For an overview of committee vs independent server types, see [Seal Server Overview](/ServerOverview).

## Overview

Committee server type uses distributed key generation (DKG) to split cryptographic keys across multiple operators. In addition to the committee member key servers, an **aggregator server** is required to collect partial key shares from members and combine them into usable decryption keys for clients. For aggregator setup, see [Aggregator Server](/Aggregator).

**What you’ll learn:**
- How to run a fresh DKG to bootstrap a new committee and generate the initial key shares
- How to configure and start a key server for a committee member
- How to rotate keys to update committee membership while preserving the same public key
- How to update a running key server to use the new key share after rotation

**How DKG works:**

The DKG process involves two roles: a **coordinator** that orchestrates the workflow, and **committee members** participate in key generation and rotation. Both fresh DKG and key rotation follow the same three-phase process:

- **Phase A — Registration:** Members generate encryption keys and register them on-chain
- **Phase B — Message creation:** Members create and exchange DKG messages off-chain
- **Phase C — Finalization:** Members process messages and propose the committee configuration on-chain

The coordinator signals members when to move from one phase to the next.

**Guide organization:**
- Fresh DKG coordinator runbook
- Fresh DKG member runbook (includes key server setup)
- Key rotation coordinator runbook
- Key rotation member runbook (includes key server configuration updates)

## Prerequisites

Before running the DKG or key rotation workflows, both the coordinator and all committee members must complete the following steps.

1. Install Sui by following the [official installation guide](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install).
```bash
sui --version
```

2. Make sure you have a CLI wallet ready on the expected network with gas.
```bash
sui client active-env
sui client active-address
sui client gas

# to create new wallet
sui client new-address ed25519

# switch if needed
sui client switch --env testnet
sui client switch --address 0x...

# to fund wallet gas: faucet.sui.io
```

3. Clone the [Seal repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/seal) and set it as your working directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/seal.git
cd seal
```

4. Build the seal-committee-cli tool.
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- --help
```

## Fresh DKG process

### Fresh DKG coordinator runbook

Follow these steps to initialize a new MPC committee using a fresh DKG.

1. **Prepare DKG configuration**

a. Make sure your CLI has the expected network and active address with gas.
```bash
sui client active-env
sui client active-address

# switch if needed
sui client switch --env testnet
sui client switch --address 0x...
```

b. Create a clean working directory named `dkg-state` and copy the example configuration file:
```bash
# in seal/
rm -rf dkg-state && mkdir dkg-state
cp crates/seal-committee-cli/dkg.example.yaml dkg-state/dkg.yaml
```

c. Collect the on-chain addresses of all participating members. Then open `dkg-state/dkg.yaml` and update the following fields:
```yaml
init-params:
  NETWORK: Testnet # Target network
  THRESHOLD: 2 # Committee threshold (t of n)
  MEMBERS: # Addresses of all participating members
    - 0x...
    - 0x...
    - 0x...
```

2. **Publish and initialize the committee**

Run the publish-and-init command:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- publish-and-init
```

This command:

- Publishes the `seal_committee` package onchain with upgrade capability
- Extracts the InitCap and UpgradeCap from the publish transaction
- Initializes the committee state and attaches the UpgradeManager (which holds the UpgradeCap) to the committee
- Appends the committee identifiers to `dkg.yaml`

For example: 
```yaml
publish-and-init:
  COMMITTEE_PKG: 0x5b788ac96879a752afbd3608a202207d75cf0f03387bcb744bfb4930cc544a70
  COMMITTEE_ID: 0x55241859c52f51dd149763769b8aa1e54de39b55acacda3f3a67629691247985
  COORDINATOR_ADDRESS: 0xef91ea73b4423e3a6176b0a1c9c6e4619de45c9c4e7c0b4aae358e292707d8c2
```

3. **Distribute configuration and notify Phase A (Registration)**

Share the updated `dkg.yaml` file with all committee members. Notify members to begin **Phase A (Registration)**.

4. **Monitor member registration**

Check on-chain registration status:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- check-committee
```

The output shows which members have registered and which are still pending. Wait until all are registered.

5. **Notify Phase B (Message creation)**

Once all members are registered:

- Notify members to begin **Phase B (Message creation)**.
- Monitor the off-chain storage (e.g. group chat) until all members upload their DKG message files.

6. **Collect and share DKG messages and notify Phase C (Finalization)**

Collect message files into a single directory and share it with members. The number of messages must equal exactly the threshold of the current committee.
```bash
rm -rf dkg-messages && mkdir dkg-messages
mv path/to/message_0.json dkg-messages/
mv path/to/message_1.json dkg-messages/
# repeat till the number of messages equals the threshold
```

Notify members to begin **Phase C (Finalization)**.

7. **Confirm committee finalization**

Monitor on-chain state until all members have proposed and the committee is finalized:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- check-committee
```

When finalization completes, the output includes the `KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID`. Share this object ID with all members so they can configure their key servers.

8. **Collect API keys for aggregator server**

After all committee members have their key servers running, ask each member to generate API credentials for the aggregator.

Collect and share the following with the aggregator operator:

- API credentials for each committee member, including:
    - The on-chain server name (the `PartialKeyServer.name` field)
    - The API key name
    - The API key
- The committee's `KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID` from the previous step.

With this information, the aggregator operator can set up the configuration and run the aggregator server. For configuration and startup instructions, see [Aggregator Server](/Aggregator).

### Fresh DKG member runbook

Follow these steps to participate as a member in a fresh DKG.

1. **Share your address with the coordinator**

Share your wallet address (`MY_ADDRESS`) with the coordinator. This address is used for all on-chain actions during the DKG.

Make sure:

- Your wallet is connected to the correct network.
- You have enough gas to submit transactions.
```bash
# check values
sui client active-address
sui client active-env
sui client gas

# switch values if needed
sui client switch --address <MY_ADDRESS>
sui client switch --env testnet
```

2. **Generate keys and register (Phase A: Registration)**

a. Wait for the coordinator to announce **Phase A (Registration)** and send you the `dkg.yaml` file containing `COMMITTEE_PKG` and `COMMITTEE_ID`. Create a local working directory named `dkg-state` and move the file there:
```bash
# in seal/
rm -rf dkg-state && mkdir dkg-state
mv path/to/dkg.yaml dkg-state/
```

b. Open `dkg.yaml` and verify the committee configuration (member addresses, threshold, committee ID) using a Sui Explorer.

c. Then run the command to generate your keys and register them on-chain by providing your server URL and name:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- genkey-and-register \
  -u <YOUR_SERVER_URL> \
  -n <YOUR_SERVER_NAME>
```

This command:

- Generates DKG key material and stores it in `dkg-state/`. Keep this directory secure.
- Appends `DKG_ENC_PK`, `DKG_SIGNING_PK`, `MY_SERVER_URL`, `MY_SERVER_NAME`, and `MY_ADDRESS` (from `sui client active-address`) to `dkg.yaml`.
- Registers your public keys on-chain.

3. **Create and share your DKG message (Phase B: Message creation)**

a. Wait for the coordinator to announce **Phase B (Message creation)**. Then initialize your local DKG state and generate your message file:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- create-message
```

This command outputs a file named `dkg-state/message_P.json`, where `P` is your party ID. 

b. Share this file with the coordinator.

4. **Process messages and propose the committee (Phase C: Finalization)**

Wait for the coordinator to announce **Phase C (Finalization)** and provide a directory containing messages (for example, `path/to/dkg-messages`).

Move the directory into `dkg-state` and process the messages:
```bash
mv path/to/dkg-messages dkg-state/

cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- process-all-and-propose
```

This command:

- Processes all DKG messages from the directory.
- Appends the following fields to `dkg.yaml`:
  - `KEY_SERVER_PK`: New key server public key.
  - `PARTIAL_PKS_V0`: Partial public keys for all members.
  - `MASTER_SHARE_V0`: Your master share, used to start the key server. Back it up securely and do not share it with anyone.
- Proposes the committee on-chain by calling the `propose` function.

5. **Configure and start your key server**

a. Wait for the coordinator to confirm that the DKG is complete and share the `KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID`.

b. Create a `key-server-config.yaml` file with your address (`MY_ADDRESS`) and the key server object ID (`KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID`), and set the committee state to active:

Example config file:
```yaml
server_mode: !Committee
  member_address: '<MY_ADDRESS>'
  key_server_obj_id: '<KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID>'
  committee_state: !Active
```

c. Start the key server, setting the config path and your master key share from `dkg.yaml` (use `MASTER_SHARE_V0` for a fresh DKG):
```bash
CONFIG_PATH=crates/key-server/key-server-config.yaml MASTER_SHARE_V0=0x... cargo run --bin key-server
```

6. **Generate API credentials for the aggregator**

After your key server is running successfully, generate API credentials for aggregator access and share them with the coordinator.

- Generate an **API key name** and **API key** for your key server.
- Share the following details with the coordinator:
   - Your server name (`MY_SERVER_NAME` from `dkg.yaml`, corresponding to the on-chain `PartialKeyServer.name`)
   - API key name
   - API key

The coordinator passes these credentials to the aggregator operator, who uses them to authenticate requests to your key server.

7. **Backup and clean up local DKG state**

Once your key server is running successfully, back up the `MASTER_SHARE_V0` value. Then you can safely delete the local DKG state directory:
```bash
rm -rf dkg-state
```

## Key rotation process

Use key rotation to update the committee membership. When rotating a committee, the set of continuing members, including those present in both the current and next committee, must be large enough to meet the threshold of the current committee.

This guide assumes:

- The current committee version is `X`, and
- The rotation produces the next committee version `X+1`.

### Key rotation coordinator runbook

1. **Prepare DKG configuration**

a. Make sure your CLI has the expected network and active address with gas.
```bash
sui client active-env
sui client active-address

# switch if needed
sui client switch --env testnet
sui client switch --address 0x...
```

b. Create a clean working directory named `dkg-state` and copy the rotation example configuration:
```bash
# in seal/
rm -rf dkg-state && mkdir dkg-state
cp crates/seal-committee-cli/dkg-rotation.example.yaml dkg-state/dkg.yaml
```

c. Collect the addresses of all members in the **new committee** (including continuing members). Open `dkg-state/dkg.yaml` and update the following fields.

You can obtain `KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID` from the key server configuration of any continuing member in the current committee.

```yaml
init-params:
  NETWORK: Testnet # Target network
  THRESHOLD: 3  # Threshold for the new committee (t of n)
  MEMBERS:  # New committee members (may include continuing members)
    - 0x...
    - 0x...
    - 0x...
    - 0x...

# Rotation only params
init-rotation-params:
  KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID: 0x...  # Key server object ID from the current committee
```

2. **Initialize the rotation**

```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- init-rotation
```

This command:

- Fetches the current key server object to determine the existing committee ID and package ID.
- Initializes the new committee object on-chain.
- Appends the following fields to the `init-rotation` section in `dkg.yaml`:
  - `COORDINATOR_ADDRESS`: Address executing the rotation
  - `COMMITTEE_PKG`: Package ID of the committee contract
  - `CURRENT_COMMITTEE_ID`: Current committee object ID
  - `COMMITTEE_ID`: New committee object ID

3. **Distribute configuration and notify Phase A (Registration)**

Share the updated `dkg.yaml` file with all committee members. Notify members to begin **Phase A (Registration)**.

4. **Monitor member registration**

Check on-chain registration status:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- check-committee
```

The output shows which members have registered and which are still pending. Wait until all are registered.

5. **Notify Phase B (Message creation)**

Once all members are registered:

- Notify members to begin **Phase B (Message creation)**.
- Monitor the off-chain storage (e.g. group chat) until all members upload their DKG message files.

6. **Collect and share DKG messages and notify Phase C (Finalization)**

a. Collect message files into a single directory and share it with members. The number of messages must equal exactly the threshold of the current committee.
```bash
rm -rf dkg-messages && mkdir dkg-messages
mv path/to/message_0.json dkg-messages/
mv path/to/message_1.json dkg-messages/
# repeat till the number of messages equals the threshold
```

b. Notify members to begin **Phase C (Finalization)**. 

c. Remind members that the current committee is at version `X` (e.g. 0) and it is rotating to target version `X+1` (e.g. 1). This is used to annotate `MASTER_SHARE_VX` and `MASTER_SHARE_VX+1` in the member commands.

7. **Confirm committee finalization**

Monitor on-chain state until all members have proposed and the committee is finalized:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- check-committee
```

8. **Collect API keys for aggregator server**

If new members join the committee during rotation or existing members change API credentials, ask each member to send API credentials for the aggregator.

Collect and share the following with the aggregator operator:

- API credentials for each committee member, including:
    - The on-chain server name (the `PartialKeyServer.name` field)
    - The API key name
    - The API key

With this information, the aggregator operator can update the configuration and run the aggregator server. For configuration and startup instructions, see [Aggregator Server](/Aggregator).

### Key rotation member runbook

Follow these steps to participate as a member in a key rotation.

1. **Share your address with the coordinator**

Share your wallet address (`MY_ADDRESS`) with the coordinator. This address is used for all on-chain actions during the rotation.

Make sure:

- Your wallet is connected to the correct network.
- You have enough gas to submit transactions.

2. **Generate keys and register (Phase A: Registration)**

a. Wait for the coordinator to announce **Phase A (Registration)** and send you the `dkg.yaml` file. The file includes `COMMITTEE_PKG`, `CURRENT_COMMITTEE_ID`, and `COMMITTEE_ID`. Create a local working directory named `dkg-state` and move the file there:
```bash
# in seal/
rm -rf dkg-state && mkdir dkg-state
mv path/to/dkg.yaml dkg-state/
```

b. Open `dkg.yaml` and verify the committee configuration (member addresses, threshold, committee ID) using a Sui Explorer.

c. Then run the command to generate your keys and register them on-chain by providing your server URL and name:
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- genkey-and-register \
  -u <YOUR_SERVER_URL> \
  -n <YOUR_SERVER_NAME>
```

This command:

- Generates sensitive key material and stores it in `dkg-state/`. Keep this directory secure.
- Appends `DKG_ENC_PK`, `DKG_SIGNING_PK`, `MY_SERVER_URL`, `MY_SERVER_NAME`, and `MY_ADDRESS` (from `sui client active-address`) to `dkg.yaml`.
- Registers your public keys on-chain.

3. **Create and share your DKG message (Phase B: Message creation)**

Wait for the coordinator to announce **Phase B (Message creation)**.

**For continuing members**:

a. Initialize your DKG state and generate your message file. You must pass your current master share (`MASTER_SHARE_VX`). This is the master share environment variable value that your key server is currently running with.
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- create-message -o <MASTER_SHARE_VX>
```

This command outputs `dkg-state/message_P.json`, where `P` is your party ID. 

b. Share this file with the coordinator.

**For new members**:

Initialize your DKG state. No message file is generated (new members don't create messages during rotation).
```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- init-state
```

4. **Process messages and propose the rotation (Phase C: Finalization)**

Wait for the coordinator to announce **Phase C (Finalization)** and provide a directory containing all DKG messages (for example, `path/to/dkg-messages`).

Move the directory into `dkg-state` and process the messages:
```bash
mv path/to/dkg-messages dkg-state/

cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- process-all-and-propose
```

This command:

- Processes all messages from the directory.
- Appends the following fields to `dkg.yaml`:
  - `PARTIAL_PKS_VX+1`: New partial public keys for all members.
  - `MASTER_SHARE_VX+1`: Your new master share, used to start the key server. Back it up securely and do not share it with anyone.
- Proposes the rotation on-chain by calling `propose_for_rotation`.

5. **Start or update your key server**

**For continuing members:**
a. Update `key-server-config.yaml`

- Change the committee state from *Active* to **Rotation** mode.
- Set the target committee version to `X+1` (increment 1 from the current version `X`). If you are not sure what `X` is in this rotation, check with your coordinator.
- Leave other settings unchanged.

Example config file:
```yaml
server_mode: !Committee
  member_address: '<MY_ADDRESS>'
  key_server_obj_id: '<KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID>'
  committee_state: !Rotation
    target_version: <X+1> # Increment this
```

b. Restart the key server with both the old and new master shares (`MASTER_SHARE_VX` corresponds to the current committee version `X` and `MASTER_SHARE_VX+1` corresponds to the next committee version `X+1`). The server monitors on-chain state and selects the correct share automatically.
```bash
CONFIG_PATH=crates/key-server/key-server-config.yaml \
  MASTER_SHARE_VX=<MASTER_SHARE_VX> \
  MASTER_SHARE_VX+1=<MASTER_SHARE_VX+1> \
  cargo run --bin key-server
```

c. Wait for the coordinator to confirm that rotation is complete. Then update the config to **Active** mode and restart the server with only the new master share.

Example config file:
```yaml
server_mode: !Committee
  member_address: '<MY_ADDRESS>'
  key_server_obj_id: '<KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID>'
  committee_state: !Active
```

```bash
CONFIG_PATH=crates/key-server/key-server-config.yaml \
  MASTER_SHARE_VX+1=<MASTER_SHARE_VX+1> \
  cargo run --bin key-server
```

**For new members:**

a. Create `key-server-config.yaml`. Since `X+1` is your first committee version, start the key server directly in **Active** mode.

Example config file:
```yaml
server_mode: !Committee
  member_address: '<MY_ADDRESS>'
  key_server_obj_id: '<KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID>'
  committee_state: !Active
```

b. Start the key server with the new master share `MASTER_SHARE_VX+1` that corresponds to the new committee version `X+1`.
```bash
CONFIG_PATH=crates/key-server/key-server-config.yaml \
  MASTER_SHARE_VX+1=<MASTER_SHARE_VX+1> \
  cargo run --bin key-server
```

6. **Generate API credentials for the aggregator (new members only)**

If you are joining the committee as a new member during rotation, generate API credentials after your key server is up and running and share them with the coordinator.

a. Generate an **API key name** and **API key** for your key server.
b. Share the following with the coordinator:
   - Your server name (`MY_SERVER_NAME` from `dkg.yaml`, corresponding to the on-chain `PartialKeyServer.name`)
   - API key name
   - API key

The coordinator passes these credentials to the aggregator operator, who uses them to authenticate requests to your key server.

:::note

Continuing members typically do not need to share new credentials, since their existing API keys should already be configured in the aggregator. Share new credentials only if you are rotating your API keys.

:::

7. **Backup and clean up local DKG state**

Once your key server is running successfully, back up the `MASTER_SHARE_VX+1` value. Then you can safely delete the local DKG state directory:
```bash
rm -rf dkg-state
```

## Package Upgrade

The committee can upgrade the `seal_committee` Move package through a voting process. A contract upgrade can only happen if a threshold of committee members approves the new package digest.

The upgrade follows these steps:

1. **Compute package digest**: Build the updated package and extract its digest.
2. **Committee voting**: Committee members vote for the new package digest.
3. **Execute the upgrade**: Once threshold is reached, authorize, execute and commit the upgrade.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you are on the expected network.
2. Make sure you are using the same address as the one you used to participate in the current active committee.
3. `<KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID>` can be found in your server's config file `key-server-config.yaml`.

```bash
sui client active-env
sui client active-address

# Verify the current key server status and its committee members (that contains your address).
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- check-key-server-status \
  -k <KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID> \
  -n <NETWORK>
```

### Steps

#### 1. Compute the package digest

Pull the updated package code locally and verify updates. This command computes the package digest for the committee package (`move/committee`). Make sure that all committee members have the same digest and are ready for upgrade.

```bash
# in seal/
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- package-digest -n <NETWORK>
```

This outputs:

```
Digest for package 'committee': 0xd0f13987e824f0f462911bc45d5a45004f4e3d752de2be939111274e862cc00c
```

#### 2. Approve the upgrade

Each committee member approves for the upgrade using the locally built package, run:

```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- approve-upgrade \
  -k <KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID> \
  -n <NETWORK>
```

**Notes:** 

1. To check the current upgrade proposal status (digest, votes, threshold), run:

```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- check-key-server-status \
  -k <KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID> \
  -n <NETWORK>
```

2. If needed, the local package is not what you want to approve, run this to reject it onchain.

```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- reject-upgrade \
  -p <PACKAGE_PATH>
  -k <KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID> \
  -n <NETWORK>
```

3. If needed, can run `approve-upgrade` or `reject-upgrade` again to change your vote option. 

4. If needed, if a threshold of committee members reject the upgrade, any member can reset the proposal to allow a new upgrade proposal.

```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- reset-proposal \
  -k <KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID> \
  -n <NETWORK>
```

#### 3. Authorize, execute and commit the upgrade

Once the threshold number of committee members approves the digest, any member run this to execute the upgrade:

```bash
cargo run --bin seal-committee-cli -- authorize-and-upgrade \
  -k <KEY_SERVER_OBJ_ID> \
  -n <NETWORK>
```

This command:
- Authorizes the upgrade (gets an UpgradeTicket).
- Performs the package upgrade with the ticket (gets an UpgradeReceipt).
- Commits the upgrade receipt.

## Quick reference: Fresh DKG vs Key rotation
