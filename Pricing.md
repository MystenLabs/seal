# Seal pricing

- **Choose your own key server providers:** Seal supports a decentralized network of independent key servers. Builders can select any combination of providers to form their preferred threshold configuration for encryption and decryption.
- **Transparent pricing & features:** Each key server provider sets their own pricing and rate limits based on their service model. Builders can evaluate and choose based on what best fits their application needs.
- **Curated discoverability:** This documentation will list a verified set of providers along with available links to their configuration details, terms, and pricing, so you can integrate with confidence.

## Verified key servers

### Testnet

- Mysten Labs: The following key servers are freely available for experimentation, development, and testing. A source-based rate limit is configured which can not be changed for any client.
    - mysten-testnet-1: https://seal-key-server-testnet-1.mystenlabs.com
    - mysten-testnet-2: https://seal-key-server-testnet-2.mystenlabs.com

> [!NOTE]
> Testnet key servers are provided for developer testing only and do not come with availability guarantees, SLAs, or assurances regarding long-term key persistence. Please avoid using them to encrypt data you expect to access reliably in the future.

### Mainnet

Coming soon
